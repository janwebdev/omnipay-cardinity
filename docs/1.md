## 1. Create a payment

[Cadrinity](https://cardinity.com/) supports 3DS1 and 3DS2 protocols.

### Code example:

```php
use Omnipay\Cardinity\Gateway;
use Omnipay\Cardinity\Message\Response\PurchaseResponse;
use Omnipay\Omnipay;

/** @var Gateway $gateway */
$gateway = Omnipay::create(Gateway::getGatewayClass());

$gateway->setConsumerKey('123456789');
$gateway->setConsumerSecret('abcde123456');

$options = [
    "amount" => "50.00",
    "currency" => "EUR",
    "description" => "some description",
    "order_id" => "123456789",
    "country" => "LT",
    "payment_instrument" => [
        "pan" => "4111111111111111",
        "exp_year" => 2021,
        "exp_month" => 11,
        "cvc" => "999",
        "holder" => "John Doe"
    ],
    "threeds2_data" => [
        "notification_url" => "https://www.myonlineshop.com/callback/3dsv2",
        "browser_info" => [
            "accept_header" => "text/html",
            "browser_language" => "en-US",
            "screen_width" => 1920,
            "screen_height" => 1040,
            "challenge_window_size" => "full-screen",
            "user_agent" => "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:21.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/21.0",
            "color_depth" => 24,
            "time_zone" => 3
        ]
    ],
    "statement_descriptor_suffix" => "Testing purchase payment",
    "callback_url" => "https://www.myonlineshop.com/callback/3dsv2"
];

/** @var PurchaseResponse $payment */
$payment = $gateway->purchase($options)->send();

$transactionId = $payment->getTransactionReference(); // unique gateway's payment identifier

if ($payment->isRedirect()) {
    $payment->redirect();
}

if ($payment->isSuccessful()) {
    // do needed logic
}
```

despite almost all parameters in the ```$options``` array are self explanatory, notice:
- ```order_id``` - is your unique order identificator
- ```threeds2_data.notification_url``` - is a callback url, where you receive 3DS2 data
- ```threeds2_data.browser_info``` - you may prepare on the frontend with javascript or with php "browscap" extension
- ```statement_descriptor_suffix``` - is not obligatory, but it shows in bank statement as the payment target
- ```callback_url``` - can be the same as ```threeds2_data.notification_url``` - is a callback url, where you receive 3DS1 data

### Processing 3DSx data on callback url:
Your code logic should be prepared to process the following parameters:
#### for 3DS1:
- ```MD``` - your unique order identifier
- ```PaRes``` - payer authentication response; this value should be sent to Cardinity during the [payment finalization](https://github.com/janwebdev/omnipay-cardinity/tree/main/docs/2.md)
#### for 3DS2:
- ```cres``` - challenge response code; this value should be sent to Cardinity during the [payment finalization](https://github.com/janwebdev/omnipay-cardinity/tree/main/docs/2.md)
- ```threeDSSessionData``` - your unique order identifier

You need fo [complete the payment](https://github.com/janwebdev/omnipay-cardinity/tree/main/docs/2.md) only if customer's (payer's) card needs/supports 3DSx protocol. You can check this state with the helper method
```php
// ...
if ($payment->isPending()) {
    // it is needed to complete payment
}
// ...
```
The payment may also be instantly declined:
```php
if ($payment->isDeclined()) {
    $reason = $payment->getError();
}
```
