## 3. Create authorized payment

#### Do you know the difference between purchase and authorization?
```
Authorization just reserves particular amount of money in cardholder's account. 
Then it must be settled (completed) by you within 7 days and only then money will reach your account. 
Purchase does both of these actions at the same time.
```

### Code example:

```php
use Omnipay\Cardinity\Gateway;
use Omnipay\Cardinity\Message\Response\PurchaseResponse;
use Omnipay\Omnipay;

/** @var Gateway $gateway */
$gateway = Omnipay::create(Gateway::getGatewayClass());

$gateway->setConsumerKey('123456789');
$gateway->setConsumerSecret('abcde123456');

$options = [
    "amount" => "50.00",
    "currency" => "EUR",
    "description" => "some description",
    "order_id" => "123456789",
    "country" => "LT",
    "payment_instrument" => [

    ],
    "statement_descriptor_suffix" => "Testing purchase payment",
    "callback_url" => "https://www.myonlineshop.com/callback/3dsv2"
];

/** @var PurchaseResponse $payment */
$payment = $gateway->authorize($options)->send();

$transactionId = $payment->getTransactionReference(); // unique gateway's payment identifier

if ($payment->isRedirect()) {
    $payment->redirect();
}

if ($payment->isSuccessful()) {
    // do needed logic
}
```
