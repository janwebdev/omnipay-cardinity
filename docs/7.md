## 7. Void a payment
**Voids are available for authorizations only!**<br>
Make sure that the transaction being voided was not previously settled (authorized).<br>
Voids of settled transactions will result in an error.
### Code example:

```php
// ...
$options = [
    'transactionReference' => '25e6f869-6675-4488-bd47-ccd298f74b3f'    
];

/** @var VoidResponse $payment */
$payment = $gateway->void($options)->send();

if ($paymeny->isSuccessful()) {
    $transactionId = $payment->getTransactionReference();
}

// useful methods
$payment->isDeclined(); // $reason = $payment->getError();
$payment->isVoid();
$voidedPaymentId = $payment->getParentPurchaseId();
```
