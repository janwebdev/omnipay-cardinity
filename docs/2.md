## 2. Complete the payment

It is needed to complete a payment if customer's (payer's) card needs/supports 3DSx protocol.

### Code example:
```php
// ...
$options = [
    'transactionReference' => '25e6f869-6675-4488-bd47-ccd298f74b3f',
    'type' => CompletePurchaseRequest::TYPE_3DSV1, // or CompletePurchaseRequest::TYPE_3DSV2
    'cres' => '123456abcdefg' // in case of 3DS2 or 'authorize_data' in case of 3DS1
];

/** @var CompletePurchaseResponse $payment */
$payment = $gateway->completePurchase($options)->send();

if ($payment->isSuccessful()) {
    // do needed logic
}
// ...
if ($payment->isDeclined()) {
    $reason = $payment->getError();
}
```
- ```transactionReference``` is gateway's unique payment's UUID, received during payment creation
- ```cres``` parameter you get to you callback url in [Creating a payment](https://github.com/janwebdev/omnipay-cardinity/tree/main/docs/1.md) in case of 3DS2
- ```authorize_data``` is a ```PaRes``` parameter you get to you callback url in [Creating a payment](https://github.com/janwebdev/omnipay-cardinity/tree/main/docs/1.md) in case of 3DS1
