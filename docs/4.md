## 4. Complete authorized payment (settlement)

An authorized payment is needed to be settled.

### Code example:

```php
// ...
$options = [
    'transactionReference' => '25e6f869-6675-4488-bd47-ccd298f74b3f',
    'amount' => '15.00' // amount to authorize
    'description' => 'description of payment'
    
];

/** @var CompleteAuthorizedResponse $payment */
$payment = $gateway->completeAuthorize($options)->send();
// ...
$transactionId = $payment->getTransactionReference();
// ...
$authorizedPaymentId = $payment->getAuthorizedPaymentId();
// ...
if ($payment->isSuccessful()) {
    // do needed logic
}
// ...
if ($payment->isDeclined()) {
    $reason = $payment->getError();
}
```
- ```transactionReference``` is gateway's unique payment's UUID, received during authorized payment creation
